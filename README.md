# andy-mentoring
In this mentorship, we're going to attempt to get you to a level in Javascript where you can write high quality code to start solving problems on a granular level.
This will be mixed in with a deep dive into algorithms that we will be applying in a more practical sense.

What this will allow you to do is the following:
1. Get a job no matter what.
2. Have your own projects

By Iteration 3, we should know what type of application we would like to build. It should be a copy of or a slight improvement on a currently existing application.
What this will allow you to do is build real things that you can add to your portfolio and resume while honing your algorithmic skills so that you can actually get the interviews, and then crush them.
