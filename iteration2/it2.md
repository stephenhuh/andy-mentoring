#Algorithms
Solve 1A, 4A, 71A on Codeforces. They should be quite easy. This will get you acquainted with writing JS for Codeforces. Ping me if you need help.
Make a leetcode.com account (you will thank me later for this.) -- Solve 292 Nim Game. 

NOTE: when writing code for this in contrast to competitive programming do NOT take shortcuts. Write logical, easy-to-read code that follows patterns.

#Feedback
Make sure you note what was TOO easy for you and TOO hard for you. Write that down as well.
The more your write down about your experience the better I can help out.
