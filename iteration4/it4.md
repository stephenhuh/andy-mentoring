#Overview
We have two goals this iteration:
1. View problems as exactly what they are -- problems. And examine algorithmic paradigms as a deconstruction of problems.
2. We want to get you up to date on writing better code and more importantly writing more code. 

#Algorithms
1. Review the master theorem - you will explain it on Thursday.
2. Review recurrence relationships.
3. Review priority queues.
4. Do all the D&C Problems within CLRS.
5. Solve https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/?tab=Description  
But make sure you are using the divide and conquer approach. Look for the base case and solve this.
6. Read 15.1 slowly but surely.
Make sure you understand the term "optimal substructure" -- definitions exist on pg 425 of 16.2 and 362 of 15.1
7. Pros and cons of each approach -- and when to use.

As explained on Sunday, you want to view these problems as problems. 

#Project
##Debugging:
Understand how to debug JS and web code:

https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools

You do not have to complete all sections or go through this that rigorously. It's important though that you know what tools are available. It'll help you get a better grasp on the underlying mechanisms of Javascript and get through bugs in your project code.

##Project-Specific
Now that you have the given foods. Figure out how to display all data in a way that fits MFP when someone 
The use case is as follows:
As a fitness enthusiast, I log my macros. Unfortunately, I have only one meal left and need equal to or more than 20g of protein. I want to do a quick search for all foods that have more than 20g of protein per serving. 
When you are finished or come across a problem PM me.

Rewrite your code in the module pattern.

Start building out more of the platform if you have ANY extra time or are just bored.
